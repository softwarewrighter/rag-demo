# RAG Demo - Live Demo

This is a **limited static demo** of the RAG Demo Dashboard hosted on GitHub Pages.

⚠️ **Important:** This demo uses mocked data and does not have a real backend. It's intended to show the UI and basic interaction flow.

## To Use the Full Version

For the complete interactive experience with real document ingestion and search:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/softwarewrighter/rag-demo.git`
2. Follow the setup instructions in the main README
3. Run Qdrant and Ollama locally
4. Ingest your own documents
5. Build and serve the dashboard: `./scripts/build-dashboard.sh`

## What's Different in the Live Demo

- ✅ Shows the dashboard UI
- ✅ Demonstrates search interface
- ✅ Displays sample results
- ❌ Cannot connect to real Qdrant/Ollama backend
- ❌ Cannot ingest real documents
- ❌ Shows only pre-generated mocked data
